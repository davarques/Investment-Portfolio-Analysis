## Project Overview: 

In this practical tech assignment, we are provided with a portfolio of 5 investment assets, and our goal is to apply our Python knowledge to review and assess the investment portfolio.

### Available Datasets

| Dataframes              |

| [Asset Price Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EwcJlExRlA7Ym3LakOrKm6SD360d_iey/view?usp=drive_link)       |
| [Portfolio Weights Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RDrqtFPiiCfLMJPkiIK0gL5XRjsoiXO1/view?usp=drive_link) |

## Tasks 

- **Exercise 1: Data Loading and Price Charting**
  - Import the three available datasets: `asset_price`, `asset_information`, and `portfolio_weights`
  - Visualize the portfolio’s assets with a time series graph.

- **Exercise 2: Daily Percentage Returns**
  - Calculate asset’s daily percentage returns.
  - Calculate the correlation matrix for the five assets.
  - Create a scatter plot comparing the returns of two specific assets.

- **Exercise 3: Portfolio Analysis**
  - Create an area chart of the asset weights.
  - Plot the historical cumulative returns of the portfolio.
  - Calculate the annualized return of the portfolio.
  -  Determine the annualized volatility of the portfolio (using an annualization factor of 261 days).
  -  Produce an area chart grouping asset weights by their categories, as detailed in the `asset_information_data.csv`.
